The directory contains some commonly used templates for creating 
thesis/project reports in LaTeX. 

Please see the PDF file (mainrep.pdf) for the sample output.  The folder 
contains the entire template files, including the ones that generated
the PDF file.  These templates can be used for technical reports, thesis,
seminar reports, weekly reports, etc.  Novice users of LaTeX, can edit
the .tex files and start making changes to get their first report.

This uses IIT Bombay Report Class (iitbreport.cls)
and an authoryear type citation (iitbauthyr.bst).  It will also generate
a cover page with the IITB logo, copyright page, certificate, 
approval sheet, declaration, and acknowledgements in standard format.

Seasoned LaTeX users may also find better ways to organise a report:

 * Creating macros for math symbols
 * Creating separate files for chapters
 * Creating nomenclature
 * Partially compiling chapters
 * Visually appealing fonts for text and math (instead of the default
   Computer Modern TeX fonts)
 * Hyperlinked PDF, with PDF information, Referencing, DoI and URL
   linked bibliography
